Revision history for IPC::Exe

1.006    2009/05/02
         - RT #45413: A chain of trivial scripts is stuck under Win2k, works under Linux
           Threaded fork-emulation has limitations.
           Addressed by updating CAVEAT section in pod.
           Added *_pipe tests to account for this.

         - RT #45263: wrong constant intermediate exit code
           Fixed: $? was getting clobbered by waitpid(). Added exit tests.

         - &READER is now called with ($child_pid, LIST) as arguments.
           $child_pid allows waitpid($_[0], 0); to be called in &READER to set $?

         - Deprecated 'exec' option in %EXE_OPTIONS. No more use of system().
         - Changed: improved non-Unix quoting. Added quoting test.
         - Added: manually flush STDERR/STDOUT after &PREEXEC.
         - Added: use POSIX::_exit() upon failed exec to avoid calling END blocks.
         - Added: use lib "../lib"; to examples/*.pl
         - Minor changes to "README" and "Makefile.PL".

1.005    2009/04/21
         - Fixed: unknown open() mode '>&' to be compatible with Perl 5.6+.

         - Added: LICENSE to "META.yml".

1.004    2009/04/20
         - Fixed: found = in conditional, should be ==.
           use warnings; doesn't understand what I mean.

         - Changed: exec() failure code sequence.

         - Included "META.yml" in dist.
         - Extracted license info from "README" into its own file "LICENSE".
         - Skip 'background' test in "02_IPC-Exe.t" if not in DEBUG mode.
           Testing bg() requires manual inspection.
